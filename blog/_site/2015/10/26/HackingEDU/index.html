<p>Fresh off my hackathon victory at Dubhacks 2015, I flew to HackingEDU in San Mateo, California, an event which was set to host 1500+ hackers from across the world.</p>

<p>Once again, I was drawn to the event due to its substantial nature (both in terms of competitors, prizes, and travel reimbursements). Upon arriving at the venue (San Mateo Event Center - which was a random area south of San Fransisco), my speculations were correct. In addition to the numerous sponsors, I was able to get mentorship and listen to talks from some of the greatest minds in tech:</p>

<li>
Sal Khan - Founder of Khan Academy
</li>
<li>
Sam Altman - President at Y-Combinator
</li>
<li>
Andrew Sutherland - Founder at Quizlet
</li>
<li>
Jack Herrick - Founder at WikiHow
</li>
<li>
Tony Conrad - Founder of About.me
</li>
<li>
Mike Osie - CIO at Chegg
</li>
<li>
Laurie Voss - Founder at NPM
</li>
<li>
Guillermo Rauch - Founder at Socket.io
</li>
<li>
Randy Turbush - Founder at Apache
</li>

<p>â€¦ and many many more.</p>

<p>As for the hackathon itself, I teamed up with Bryan from Berkley, who I met at the event, and a Clement from Waterloo. Although Bryan had never coded before, we were able to work effectively within a team to create a product that satisfied a growing pain-point in the education industry. To learn more about our product, please visit this <a href="http://devpost.com/software/query-sctlva">link</a>.</p>

<p>In the end, we were able to pitch our product to some prominent industry professionals and make a positive impression. So much so that we WON the largest cash prize at the event - the Clusterpoint Award. This award capped off an amazing experience - one full of great people, great food, and great experiences. In addition to the event, I had an opportunity to tour Palo Alto and the Stanford Campus. I would recommend the event to anyone planning on applying to <a href="http://hackingedu.co">HackingEDU 2016</a>!</p>
