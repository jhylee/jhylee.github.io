  <p>The Facebook Global Hackathon Finals was an <b>lifechanging</b> experience. I’ve never been surrounded with such bright, motivated individuals - most belonging to the likes of MIT, Yale and Stanford.</p>

<p>From the very first day in San Fransisco, we were treated like royalty - I’m not surprised why Facebook is a perennial contender for the best place to live in the world.</p>

<p>Once touching down in San Fransisco, we were each given a Facebook Uber Account, which we could use to get around town. Using this code, I Ubered 40+ minutes to our hotel, the Hotel Aloft Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>At the hotel, we were each given huge individual rooms, which comprised of two king beds, a couch/office area, a kitchen, and a nice jacuzzi style bathroom. Living true to its Silicon Valley name, the hotel offered room service operated by a robot (!!!).</p>

<p>After settling in, the 70 finalists participated in a mix and mingle, where I personally had a chance to connect with finalists from across the world, including Spain, Poland, Singapore, and Russia.</p>

<p>The next day, we were treated to a tour of Facebook’s Menlo Park campus. After walking through the campus, I can confirm that the rumours are correct. Facebook’s campus is host to the finest foods (from Korean, Japanese, Jamaican, American - you can find whatever food you desire) and the best perks (arcades, ice cream shops, laundry, gym, art shop), which are all complimentary services for employees. I personally had a chance to try the udon bar and the gelato joint, both of which were absolutely fantastic.</p>

<p>After our tour, we began the hacking. We were the only team from a Canadian University, and we planned an ambitious project for a 24 hour hackathon. Our team built a social radio application that strives to eliminate the issue of distracted driving. In summary, the application “reads” your latest Facebook updates to you in real time, while allowing you to interact (like/comment) with the updates using just your voice. This extends to pictures updates, which our intelligent program analyzes to describe what is happening in the photo posted.</p>

<p>Although we didn’t place in the top three teams, I snagged a Phantom 3 Standard drone through a raffle. I have to say that I’m pretty stoked to have luck on my side in my three hackathons so far!</p>

<p>After the hackathon, I had a free hours on my hands so I decided to head to downtown San Fransisco. See below for some highlights from my downtown excursion!</p>
