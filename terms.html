                                <p>The Terms of Use control the relationship between Coastline Market and the user. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
                                    <br> If there is a conflict between the Terms of Use and additional terms agreed to by the user and Coastline Market, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
                                    <br> If the User does not comply with the Terms of Use and Coastline Market does not immediate take action, Coastline Market is not giving up any rights that Coastline Market may have (such as the right to take action in
                                    the future).
                                    <br> Any cause of action or claim the user may have with respect to these Terms of Use must be commenced within six (6) months after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action shall be barred.
                                    <br> If it turns out that a particular term or section of the Terms of Use is not enforceable this will not affect any other term or section of the Terms of Use.
                                    <br> The laws of the Province of Ontario, without reference to conflicts of law principles, will apply to the Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms of Use. All claims arising out of or relating
                                    to the Terms of Use shall be litigated exclusively in federal or provincial courts of Ontario, Canada and the user and Coastline Market consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
                                    <br> The user irrecoverably waives the right to trial by jury, and the user agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (a) no claims by the user shall be joined with any other and the user agrees not to participate
                                    in any claim brought by others; (b) THE USER HAS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE LITIGATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; and (c) you have no right or authority for any dispute
                                    to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
