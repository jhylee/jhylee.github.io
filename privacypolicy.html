                            <p>This Privacy Policy was written to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your information. Since technology and privacy laws are always changing, we may occasionally update this policy. If a significant change
                                is made, we will be sure to post a notice on our home page and in the merchant admin. If you continue to use Coastline Market after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
                                <br>
                                </br>By signing up for any of the products or services offered by Coastline Market (together, the “Services”), or dealing with a buyer using Coastline Market Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy
                                and, as applicable, the  <a href="terms" style="font-weight: 600; color: #000">Coastline Terms of Use</a>. This policy is a legally binding agreement between you (and your client, employer or another entity if you are acting
                                on their behalf) as the user of the Services (referred to as “you” or “your”) and Coastline Market Inc. and its affiliates, including but not limited to Coastline Market Inc. (referred to as “we”, “our”, “us” or “Coastline”).
                                If we add any new features or tools to our Services, they will also be subject to this policy.
                                <br>
                                </br>We will keep your Personal Information accurate, complete and up-to-date with the information that you provide to us. If you request access to your Personal Information, we will inform you of the existence, use and
                                disclosure of your Personal Information as allowed by law, and provide you access to that information.

                                </br>When we use the term “Personal Information” in this policy, it means any information related to an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee

                            <p>This Privacy Statement (“Statement") applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our apps or Services to request selling, subcontracted delivery, place an order or other on-demand services (“Users”). This Statement does
                                not apply to information we collect from or about operators, couriers, partner transportation companies, or any other persons who use the Coastline Market platform under license (collectively “operators”). If you interact
                                with the Services as both a User and an Operator, the respective privacy statements apply to your different interactions.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-left">Information You Provide to Us</h4>
                            <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name,
                                email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested (for delivery services), delivery notes, and other information you choose to provide.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="text-left">Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</h4>

                            <h5 class "text-left">A. Location Information</h5>
                            <p>When you use the Services for traceability or delivery, we collect precise location data about the trip from the Coastline app used by the operator & user. If you permit the Coastline app to access location services through
                                the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate
                                location from your IP address.</p>

                            <h5 class "text-left">B. Transaction Information</h5>
                            <p>When you use the Services for traceability or delivery, we collect precise location data about the trip from the Coastline app used by the operator & user. If you permit the Coastline app to access location services through
                                the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate
                                location from your IP address.</p>

                            <h5 class "text-left">C. Usage and Preference Information</h5>
                            <p>We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases, we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that
                                create and maintain unique identifiers.</p>

                            <h5 class "text-left">D. Device Information</h5>
                            <p>We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers,
                                serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</p>

                            <h5 class "text-left">E. Log Information</h5>
                            <p>When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser,
                                and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-left">Important Information About Platform Permissions</h4>
                            <p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform
                                will alert you the first time the Coastline app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Coastline
                                app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change
                                over time, so we’ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-left">Information We Collect From Other Sources</h4>
                            <p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:
                                <br> • If you choose to link, create, or log in to your Coastline account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our
                                API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
                                <br> • When you request on demand services, our logistics may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.
                                <br>• If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a operator or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your
                                capacity as a User.</p>
                            <hr class="thin">

                                Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Statement.</p>
